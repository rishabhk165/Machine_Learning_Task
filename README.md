# **Customer Segmentation & Product Analysis**

## **Task Overview**
Our marketing team wants to focus on the most valuable customer segments instead of targeting everyone. The goal is to:
1. Identify **who our most profitable customers are** (age, lifestyle, spending habits, etc.).
2. Find the **top 3 most profitable products** based on transaction data.
3. Use these insights to improve marketing strategies and customer engagement.
